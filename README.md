exploration of solving a problem with different languages

## Principle

1. Take a " simple " problem.
2. Solve it in you favorite language (or simply the one you want to use).
3. Commit it to the repository, as soon as you're happy with your work.
4. Comme to the quick meeting to present your solution.
